# Mainframe Hacker

Want to hack the maineframe, just like in the movies? Now you can, with this CLI program.

## Planned features

* More complexity overall, more outputs to display to the player
* Conditional decisions that allow the player to select what to do

## Simulator flow

* When run, display a set of booting statements to simulate a movie-like VM booting up.
* Let the player run commands to see cool hacking-like outputs.
* Let the player access a simple set of CLI commands.
* Let the player end the program at any time.
* Display stats on how many and what kind of maineframes have been hacked.
